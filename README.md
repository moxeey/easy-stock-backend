## Challenges

### System Design

The system is well design in the first place due to the lack of experience I have in building SaaS system. I will be glad to have someone that will guide me design a well structured and scallable version of the intended system. in the furute I want this to be in form of microservices

### Code

This is my first project that I tried to use Test Driven development approach. I find it difficult in the first place, but after going through some articles I were able to write some test.
